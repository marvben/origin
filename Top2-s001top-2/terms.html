          <p><strong>10. CLASS ACTION WAIVER AND BINDING ARBITRATION.</strong></p>

          <p><strong>10.1. ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US RELATING IN ANY WAY TO OUR WEBSITE AND THE PRODUCTS
						ADVERTISED THEREON (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ORDERS MADE FROM ADVERTISING ON OUR WEBSITE,
						RELATED ADVERTISEMENTS AND DISCLOSURES, EMAIL MESSAGES WE SEND TO YOU, OR RELATING TO THE
						COLLECTION OR USE OF ANY INFORMATION ABOUT YOU IN CONNECTION WITH OUR WEBSITE), THESE TERMS, OR
						YOUR STATUS AS A USER WILL BE SUBMITTED TO CONFIDENTIAL ARBITRATION IN THE FEDERAL JUDICIAL
						DISTRICT IN WHICH YOU RESIDE, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU HAVE, IN ANY WAY, VIOLATED OR
						THREATENED TO VIOLATE OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.</strong></p>

          <p><strong>10.2. If you intend to seek arbitration, you must first send to us, by certified mail, a
						written Notice of Dispute ("Notice"). The Notice must be mailed 8880 Rio San Diego Drive 8th Fl
						Rio Vista Tower PMB# 805 San Diego, CA 92108. It must be addressed to the attention of Legal
						Counsel. The Notice shall describe the nature and basis of the claim or disputes and the
						specific relief sought. If we cannot reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30)
						days after the Notice is received, either party may commence arbitration.</strong></p>

          <p><strong>10.3. All arbitrations required by these Terms will be conducted under the rules of the
						American Arbitration Association. The arbitrator’s award is binding and may be entered in any
						court of competent jurisdiction. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, no
						arbitration brought under these Terms may be joined to an arbitration involving any other party
						subject to these Terms whether through class arbitration proceedings or otherwise. Unless we and
						you agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate your claim with any other claim and may
						not otherwise preside over any form of a representative, private attorney general or class
						proceeding.</strong></p>

          <p><strong>10.4. In the event that you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, We will, at
						your request, reimburse you for your payment of the arbitration filing fee, unless your claim is
						for greater than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees shall be decided by the AAA
						Rules. Requests for payment of fees should be submitted by mail to the AAA along with your
						Demand for Arbitration and We will make arrangements to pay the necessary fees directly to the
						AAA. In the event the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be
						frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal
						Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), you agree to reimburse us for all fees associated with the
						arbitration paid by us on your behalf that you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the
						AAA’s rules.</strong></p>

          <p><strong>If your claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be
						conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a non-appearance
						based telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. Any
						in-person arbitration hearings will take place at a location to be agreed upon by Us. Regardless
						of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned
						written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the
						decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes
						pertaining to payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding
						and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the
						merits.</strong></p>

          <p><strong>10.5. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU WILL NOT AGREE TO ACT AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE OR
						A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, OR IN ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY, OR PARTICIPATE AS A MEMBER
						OF A CLASS OF CLAIMANTS IN ANY LAWSUIT AGAINST US IN ANY COURT, OR IN ARBITRATION, WITH RESPECT
						TO ANY CLAIMS RELATING IN ANY WAY TO US OR OUR WEBSITE INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ORDERS MADE
						FROM OUR WEBSITE, OUR ADVERTISEMENTS AND DISCLOSURES, EMAIL OR RELATING TO THE COLLECTION OR USE
						OF ANY INFORMATION ABOUT YOU IN CONNECTION WITH OUR WEBSITE, THESE TERMS, OR YOUR STATUS AS A
						PURCHASER OF OUR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES. THIS SECTION 14 WILL SURVIVE THE TERMINATION OF THE
						RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU AND US.</strong></p>

          <p><strong>15. Applicable law.</strong> By visiting our Website, you agree that the laws of Canada, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern these Terms and any dispute of any sort that might arise between you
            and us.</p>

          <p><strong>16. General Terms.</strong> No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment relationship is created as a result of these Terms. These terms constitute the entire agreement between us. Our failure to exercise or enforce
            any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of the enforcement of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or
            eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. These Terms are not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by you, except with our prior written
            consent. The headings in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. These Terms include and incorporate by reference the posted Privacy Policy on our Website.
